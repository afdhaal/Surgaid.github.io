Understanding the intricate anatomy of the neck and the layered dissection involved is paramount for safe and effective tracheostomy placement.\nAnatomical Considerations # 1. Surface Anatomy: Tracheostomy is typically performed between the second and fourth tracheal rings, corresponding to the level of the cricoid cartilage (C6 vertebrae level). Surface landmarks include the cricoid cartilage and the thyroid isthmus (if present), guiding the surgeon to the midline of the neck.\n2. Superficial Layers:\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue: Initial incision is made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, ensuring careful hemostasis to minimize bleeding and prevent hematoma formation. Platysma Muscle: This thin, superficial muscle is divided to expose deeper structures. 3. Deep Layers:\nPre-Tracheal Fascia: Beneath the platysma lies the pre-tracheal fascia, a dense connective tissue layer that encapsulates the thyroid gland, trachea, and esophagus. Thyroid Gland: The thyroid gland may need to be retracted or partially mobilized during the dissection, depending on its size and position relative to the trachea. 4. Surgical Approach:\nMidline Incision: An incision is made along the midline, dividing the strap muscles longitudinally to expose the thyroid gland and trachea. Strap Muscles: These include the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and thyrohyoid muscles, which are carefully separated or retracted to access the trachea. Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve: Attention must be paid to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve that loops around the subclavian artery on the right and the aortic arch on the left, as damage can lead to vocal cord paralysis. 5. Tracheal Dissection:\nOpening the Trachea: Once the trachea is exposed, a transverse incision is made through the anterior tracheal wall between the second and fourth tracheal rings. Cricoid Cartilage: The cricoid cartilage serves as a landmark for the lower border of the incision, ensuring adequate clearance and reducing the risk of stenosis. 6. Tube Placement:\nTracheostomy Tube: A fenestrated or non-fenestrated tracheostomy tube is inserted through the tracheal opening, secured with sutures, and connected to a ventilator or oxygen supply as needed. Confirmation: Proper tube positioning is confirmed by auscultation, capnography, and chest X-ray to ensure correct placement and lung inflation. Complications and Postoperative Care # Despite meticulous surgical technique, tracheostomy carries risks such as bleeding, infection, tube misplacement, and damage to adjacent structures. Close monitoring in the postoperative period is essential to mitigate these risks and ensure optimal patient outcomes.\nConclusion # The surgical anatomy of tracheostomy underscores the importance of precise knowledge and skill in dissecting the layers of the neck. Understanding the relationship between superficial and deep structures, along with the critical landmarks like the cricoid cartilage and thyroid isthmus, facilitates safe and effective tracheostomy placement. Surgeons must navigate these complexities with care, always prioritizing patient safety and well-being.\nIn conclusion, mastering the surgical anatomy of tracheostomy through layered dissection is fundamental for healthcare providers involved in airway management and critical care, ensuring that this life-saving procedure is performed with precision and expertise.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/surgery/longcase/genitourinary/bladder-ca/","title":"üëí Bladder CA","section":"ü¶¥ Orthopedic Bay","content":" Haematuria History # True Haematuria or Not # Exact Color: Dark tea color (OJ) Exclude Pseudohaematuria: Itching \u0026amp; steatorrhoea Factitious Haematuria: Munchausen‚Äôs syndrome, narcotic seeking behavior Past History # Bleeding diathesis \u0026amp; other bleeding manifestations Relation of Gross Haematuria to Urinary Stream # Initial (urethra distal to urogenital diaphragm) Total (bladder proper or upper urinary tract) Terminal (trigone/ bladder neck of prostatic urethra) Painless or Painful # Painless: Malignant but can cause pain due to clot colics Painful: Urinary tract infection or calculus, papillary necrosis, passage of clots, obstruction, loin-pain haematuria syndrome, glomerulonephritis Clots # Indicate non-glomerular bleeding Large, thick, irregular clots - bladder Small, linear clots - upper tract Passage of tissues Associated Symptoms # LUTS Fever, chills \u0026amp; rigors with loin pain or suprapubic pain Any loin pain with self-felt loin lumps (Classic triad of RCC 10% - haematuria+loin pain+loin mass) Tissue passage Vaginal or penile discharge, sexual activity Presence of urinary catheter Relation to menstruation (endometriosis) Anemic symptoms GU History # History of BPH, stone disease (Hx of GU cancers) Hx of instrumentation Hx of pelvic irradiation Aetiology for Malignancies # Smoking Occupational exposure to dye stuffs and rubber compounds Hx of travel to middle east countries (Schistosoma haematobium) Family history malignancy (bleeding diathesis + renal disease) Metastatic Features # Fitness for Sx PMHx- # PSHx- # Drug Hx- # Antiplatelets or anticoagulants, cyclophosphamide SHx- # Job(risk factors)/family Smoking/alcohol Disability/concerns Examination # General # Anemia/plethora Facial oedema/ periorbital oedema, rather than ankle edema suggest renal pathology Unilateral or bilateral ankle edema- think of Iliac vein compression in unilateral edema Bone tenderness Muscle weakness Malignant cachexia- anaemia asthenia anorexia Ask for BP Abdomen # Palpable suprapubic mass- distended bladder, anterior wall bladder tumor Ballotable renal mass Hepatomegaly Ascites DRE \u0026amp; genital Ex (non-reducing left varicocele) Summary # This 60 yrs old ASA 2, MET score \u0026gt;4, male patient with episodic visible haematuria over 3 months associated with occasional clots \u0026amp; passage of tissues.

As the thickening increases, the fascia becomes attached to the skin of the palm. Risk factors No obvious predisposing cause Cirrhosis Repeated local trauma Shoe repairers Manual labourers. Epilepsy Age Dupuytren‚Äôs contracture usually begins in middle age, but usually progresses so slowly that most patients do not present until old age. Symptoms Early There is a nodule in the palm. The patient may notice a thickening in the tissues in the palm of the hand, near the base of the ring finger, many years before the contractures develop Late Contraction deformities occur. The patient notices an inability to fully extend the metacarpophalangeal joint of the ring finger, and later the little finger. There is usually no pain associated with this condition, but the nodule in the palm may be slightly tender. Deep creases form where the skin becomes tethered to the fascial thickening, and the skin in these creases may get soggy and excoriated. Multiplicity Dupuytren‚Äôs contracture is commonly bilateral and can also occur in the feet. Risk factor Dupuytren‚Äôs contracture may follow repeated trauma to the palm of the hand, which is probably why it used to be found in shoe repairers and other manual workers, but nowadays it is uncommon to find a convincing cause. may be symptoms of epilepsy or cirrhosis of the liver.There is a higher incidence of the condition in patients suffering from these diseases. If so, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Examination Palpation of the palm of the hand reveals a firm, irregularly shaped nodule with indistinct edges, 1‚Äì2 cm proximal to the base of the ring finger. Taut strands can be felt running from the nodule to the sides of the base of the ring and little fingers, and proximally towards the centre of the flexor retinaculum. The skin is puckered and creased, and tethered to the underlying nodule. The deformity The metacarpophalangeal joint and the proximal interphalangeal joint are flexed because the palmar fascia is attached to both sides of the proximal and middle phalanges. The distal interphalangeal joint tends to extend.The ring finger is most affected and may be pulled down so far that its nail digs into the palm of the hand (Fig. The flexion deformity is not lessened by flexing the wrist joint. There may be some thickening of the subcutaneous tissue on the back of the proximal phalanges of the affected fingers, sometimes called Garrod‚Äôs pads. The condition may be present in the feet (lederhosen disease) or penis (Peyronie‚Äôs disease). Congenital contracture of the little finger # The patient is rarely aware of the fact that they have a deformity, accepting it as the normal shape of their little finger. It is mentioned here because, although it is the opposite deformity to a Dupuytren‚Äôs contracture, the student who is unaware of its existence may misdiagnose it. Someone with a congenital contracture of the little finger has this deformity all the time and cannot straighten the finger (Fig. Volkmann‚Äôs ischaemic contracture # This is a shortening of the long flexor muscles of the forearm, caused by fibrosis of the muscles, secondary to ischaemia. The common causes of the ischaemia are direct arterial damage at the time of a fracture near the elbow (most often a supracondylar fracture (see below), a tight plaster that restricts blood flow and arterial embolism. Indeed, the loss of finger movements frequently begins while the arm is immobilized for the treatment of the fracture. Symptoms When muscles become ischaemic, they are usually painful. If a patient complains of pain under their plaster at a point distant from the site of the fracture, remove the plaster and examine the muscles carefully. Movements of the fingers, especially extension, become painful and then limited. The patient soon discovers that they can extend their fingers if they flex their wrist when the forearm is not in a plaster cast. The skin of the hand will be cold and pale as the blood supply of the hand is also diminished. Ischaemia of the nerves in the anterior compartment (the median and anterior interosseous nerves) often causes ‚Äòpins and needles‚Äô (paraesthesia) in the distribution of the median nerve, and sometimes the severe burning pain of ischaemic neuritis. Development As the acute phase passes, the pain slowly fades away, but the restriction of finger extension increases, and the hand becomes claw- like. Inspection The skin of the hand is usually pale, and the hand looks wasted. All the finger joints are flexed, and the anterior aspect of the forearm is thin and wasted. The deformity is called a ‚Äòclaw hand‚Äô (Fig. Palpation In the acute phase, the forearm is swollen and tense, but once this has passed the forearm feels thin, the hand is cool and the pulses at the wrist may be absent. In the later stages, the fibrosis and shortening make the forearm muscles hard and taut. Movement Extension of the fingers is limited, but improves as the wrist is flexed. Further flexion of the fingers (beyond the deformity) can occur, but the grip is weak. Passive forced extension of the fingers is painful in the acute stage and uncomfortable in the established condition. An important diagnostic feature of an ischaemic contracture is that all the muscles, even the damaged ones, have some function, whereas in a claw hand caused by a nerve lesion, some of the muscles are completely paralysed. The heart, great vessels, subclavian and axillary arteries must be examined carefully in case they are the source of an arterial embolus. Palpate the supraclavicular fossa for a cervical rib (see Chapter 9) or subclavian artery aneurysm (see Chapter 10). Carpal tunnel syndrome # The compression can be caused by skeletal abnormalities, swelling of other tissues within the tunnel, or thickening of the retinaculum. It is often associated with pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, myxoedema, previous trauma and osteoarthritis, which all reduce the change in pressure/volume relationship. Age and sex Carpal tunnel syndrome is common in middle-aged females, especially at the menopause. Local symptoms Pins and needles in the fingers, principally the index and middle fingers, is the common presenting symptom. The thumb is sometimes involved. Theoretically, the little finger should never be affected, as it is innervated by the ulnar nerve, but occasionally patients complain that the whole of their hand tingles. Pain in the forearm may also occur. For some (so far unexplained) reason, patients often complain of a pain that radiates from the wrist, up along the medial side of the forearm. There may be an associated loss of hand function. As the compression increases, the axons in the nerve are killed, and objective signs of nerve damage appear. Because the sensitivity of the skin supplied by the median nerve is reduced, the patient notices that she drops small articles and cannot carry out delicate movements. Note that this is not caused by a loss of muscle power, but by the loss of fine discriminatory sensation. Ultimately, if the nerve damage is severe, there may be a loss of motor function, which presents as weakness and paralysis of the muscles of the thenar eminence and the first two lumbricals (see median nerve palsy in Chapter 3). Patients are often woken in the middle of the night by their symptoms. This feature is difficult to explain, but is so characteristic that it is considered to be pathognomonic of the condition. General symptoms An increase in weight commonly exacerbates the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. A change in weight may be secondary to another disease such as myxoedema, diabetes or steroid therapy, or to physiological water retention, as in pregnancy. The patient may have symptoms of arthritis in the wrist and other joints if the condition is secondary to rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Inspection The hand usually looks quite normal, except in advanced cases, where there may be visible wasting of the muscles forming the thenar eminence (Fig. Palpation Pressure on the flexor retinaculum does not produce the symptoms in the hand, but holding the wrist fully flexed for 1 or 2 minutes may induce symptoms. Light-touch sensitivity and two-point discrimination may be reduced in the skin innervated by the median nerve (palm, thumb, index and middle finger). The loss of muscle bulk in the thenar eminence may be easier to feel when these muscles are contracting. Abduction, adduction and opposition of the thumb may be weak, but the muscles that cause these movements are seldom completely paralysed. First, you must exclude other causes of paraesthesia in the hand, such as cervical spondylosis, cervical rib, peripheral neuritis and rare neurological disease. This requires a detailed examination of the head, neck and arm. Second, you must look for evidence of the cause of the carpal tunnel syndrome, such as pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis or myxoedema. Claw hand # This is a deformity in which all the fingers are permanently flexed (Fig. Although an ulnar nerve paralysis makes the hand claw-like, because it causes flexion of the ring and little fingers, it does not cause a true claw hand, because only part of the hand is involved. The causes of claw hand are neurological and musculoskeletal (see Revision panel‚Ä¶ Neurological causes the causes of claw hand (main en griffe) Combined ulnar and median nerve palsy Volkmann‚Äôs ischaemic contracture Advanced rheumatoid arthritis Brachial plexus lesion (medial cord) Spinal cord lesions: Syringomyelia Poliomyelitis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis the deformity is caused by a loss of motor function, there is often an associated sensory loss: ‚Äì trauma to the medial roots and cords, especially birth injuries of the lower cord, as in Klumpke‚Äôs paralysis; infiltration of the brachial plexus by malignant disease. ‚Äì traumatic division of the median and ulnar nerves; peripheral neuritis. Musculoskeletal causes Volkmann‚Äôs ischaemic contracture‚Ä¶ ‚óè Joint disease‚Ä¶ trigger finger # This is a condition in which a finger gets locked in full flexion and will only extend after excessive voluntary effort, or with help from the other hand. When extension begins, it does so suddenly and with a click‚Ä¶ The condition is caused by a thickening of the flexor tendon or paratenon, or a narrowing of the flexor sheath, preventing movement of the tendon within the flexor sheath. Symptoms The patient complains that the finger clicks and jumps as it moves, or gets stuck in a flexed position. A trigger finger is not usually a painful condition, even when force is required to extend it. Cause The patient can occasionally recall an injury to the palm of the hand, which may have caused the tendon or tendon sheath to thicken, but in most cases there is no indication of the cause. Inspection The patient will show you how the finger gets stuck and how it snaps out into extension. Palpation and movement The thickening of the tendon or tendon sheath can be felt at the level of the head of the metacarpal bone. Mallet finger # This is a fixed flexion deformity of the distal interphalangeal joint of a finger, caused by an interruption of the extensor mechanism, either by a rupture of the extensor tendon, or by an avulsion fracture of its insertion. It is also known as ‚Äòbaseball‚Äô finger because the most common cause of the injury is a blow on the tip of the finger by a ball or hard object that forcibly flexes it against the pull of the extensor tendon, which then ruptures or pulls off the bone. The patient usually remembers the original injury but, if the finger is not painful, may not complain about it until the deformity is established and a nuisance. Symptoms The inability to extend the tip of a finger is not a great disability, but for a person with an occupation that requires fine finger movements, including full extension of the distal interphalangeal joints, the deformity can be a serious handicap. When the patient holds out their hand, with the fingers extended, the distal phalanx of the affected finger remains flexed to 15‚Äì20¬∞ (Fig. Ganglion # A ganglion is an encapsulated myxomatous degeneration of fibrous tissue. Symptoms The patient complains of a sharp pain at the base of one finger whenever they grip something tightly. They may also notice a lump at the site of the pain. Site A small, tender nodule can be felt on the palmar surface of the base of a finger, superficial to the flexor sheath. Tenderness Direct pressure on the lump is usually very painful. Shape The nodule is spherical or hemispherical (Fig. Size Flexor sheath ganglia are usually quite small; some cause symptoms when they are only 2‚Äì3 mm in diameter. Surface and edge The surface of the nodule is smooth, and the edge sharply defined. Composition The nodule feels solid and hard. It is usually too small to permit the assessment of any other features such as fluctuation or translucency. Comment Benign giant cell tumours of the flexor sheath present in an identical manner, and are indistinguishable from flexor sheath ganglia. Heberden‚Äôs nodes are bony swellings close to the distal finger joints. They are non-specific, and do not indicate any particular disease. The patient complains of swelling and deformity of their knuckles. There may be a history of an old injury to the finger, or aching pains in both the lumps and the joints. Heberden\u0026rsquo;s nodes # Heberden‚Äôs nodes are commonly found on the dorsal surface of the fingers just distal to the distal interphalangeal joint. They are not mobile, and can be easily recognized as part of the underlying bone (Fig. The joint movements may be slightly restricted by osteoarthritis, and there may be radial deviation of the distal phalanx. The index finger is most often affected. Small adventitious bursae may develop between the skin and the nodes. Comment Heberden‚Äôs nodes do not indicate any specific underlying bone or joint disease, and have no clinical significance.They should not be confused with rheumatoid nodules, which are areas of necrosis ‚ÄòSwan neck‚Äô deformity of the fingers This deformity is hyperextension of the proximal interphalangeal joint, and flexion of the distal interphalangeal joint. surrounded by fibroblasts and chronic inflammatory cells, and are found in all types of connective tissue. Patients with rheumatoid nodules invariably have other evidence of rheumatoid arthritis. Rhumatoid arthritis # All the deformities of rheumatoid arthritis result from the combination of an uneven pull by the tendons and destruction of the joint surfaces. Boutonni√®re deformity (a) opposite of those of the ‚Äòswan neck‚Äô deformity: flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint, and hyperextension of the distal interphalangeal joint (Fig. Thickening of the joints The joints most affected are the metacarpophalangeal and the proximal interphalangeal joints. Swelling of these joints gives the finger a fusiform, spindle shape. Ulnar deviation of the fingers The fingers are pulled towards the ulnar side of the hand, causing a varus deformity at the metacarpophalangeal joints. Flexion of the wrist The wrist joint develops a fixed flexion deformity and usually some ulnar deviation (Fig. In severe rheumatoid arthritis, any tendon may undergo attrition (damage from friction) and rupture. The most common tendons to rupture are the long extensor tendons of the fingers and thumb. Compound palmar ‚Äòganglion‚Äô # This is a term that is applied to an effusion in the synovial sheath that surrounds the flexor tendons. In the UK, it is now invariably secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, but in many other parts of the world it is almost always caused by a tuberculous synovitis. The most common presenting symptom is swelling on the anterior aspect of the wrist and sometimes in the palm of the hand. Pain is uncommon. The patient may notice crepitus during movements of the fingers. Paraesthesia may occur in the distribution of the median nerve. Distension of the flexor tendon synovial sheath produces a soft, fluctuant swelling that can be felt on the anterior aspect of the wrist and lower forearm, and in the palm of the hand. Because the swelling passes beneath the flexor retinaculum, compression of the lump on one side of the retinaculum makes it distend on the other side. Crepitus may be felt during palpation and when the patient moves their fingers. ‚Äì commonly called ‚Äòmelon seed bodies‚Äô. There are no local signs of inflammation. the joints should be examined to exclude rheumatoid arthritis, and the chest should be examined (and X-rayed) to exclude tuberculosis. The fingernails # The nails are usually pale pink. The most common cause of nail pallor is anaemia. Splinter Haemorrhage # Splinter haemorrhages are small extravasations of blood from the vessels of the nail bed caused by minute arterial emboli. They are long, thin, red‚Äì brown streaks, their long axis running towards the end of the finger.Their colour and shape make them look like splinters of wood beneath the nail (see Fig. The presence of splinter haemorrhages is an important physical sign because they are usually caused by emboli from a bacterial endocarditis or a fulminating septicaemia. They may also occur in rheumatoid arthritis, mitral stenosis and severe hypertension. Clubbing # If you look at your finger from the side, you will see that the plane of the nail and the plane of the skin covering the base of the nail bed form an angle of 130‚Äì170¬∞ (see Chapter 1). In clubbed nails, there is hypertrophy of the tissue beneath the nail bed, which makes the base of the nail bulge upwards, and distorts nail growth so that the nail becomes curved. The terminal phalanx may enlarge to make the end of the finger bulbous (Revision panel 4.11). Spoon shaped nails # (Koilonychia) A normal nail is convex transversely and longitudinally, the degree of curvature varying considerably from person to person. Loss of both these curves produces a hollowed-out spoon-shaped nail (koilonychia) (see Fig. When a patient complains that their nails have changed from a normal to a spoon shape, it is very likely that they have developed anaemia following chronic loss of blood, usually from menorrhagia or haemorrhoids. Subungual haematoma and melanoma # A collection of blood beneath the nail is called a subungual haematoma. It is then important to decide whether the brown spot is haemosiderin or melanin‚Ä¶ A haematoma is usually reddish-brown, with sharp edges. A melanoma is brown with a greyish tinge, and has indistinct edges (Fig. Haematomas move down the nail; melanomas do not move. If it is not possible to make a definite clinical diagnosis, the patient should be managed as if they have a melanoma until you prove otherwise. Glomous tumor # This is a very rare tumour, but is mentioned because it can cause a great deal of pain, and often occurs beneath the nail. It is an angioneuromyoma. The patient complains of severe pain every time the nail is touched.

It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The Go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates # Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the Go docs.\nBasic Syntax # Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }} Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }} Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }} Variables # Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }} Functions # Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Includes # When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }} Logic # Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration # Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Conditionals # If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\nfalse 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Pipes # One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }} is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }} It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }} Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }} Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }} Context (aka. the dot) # The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n{{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters # Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters # In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Permalinks\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2013-11-18\u0026#34; aliases: - \u0026#34;/doc/permalinks/\u0026#34; groups: [\u0026#34;extras\u0026#34;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n{{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Using Site (config) Parameters # In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/twitter.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; "},{"id":26,"href":"/posts/hugoisforlovers/","title":"Getting Started with Hugo","section":"üçÄ Surgical Notes","content":" Step 1.
