Understanding the intricate anatomy of the neck and the layered dissection involved is paramount for safe and effective tracheostomy placement.\nAnatomical Considerations # 1. Surface Anatomy: Tracheostomy is typically performed between the second and fourth tracheal rings, corresponding to the level of the cricoid cartilage (C6 vertebrae level). Surface landmarks include the cricoid cartilage and the thyroid isthmus (if present), guiding the surgeon to the midline of the neck.\n2. Superficial Layers:\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue: Initial incision is made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue, ensuring careful hemostasis to minimize bleeding and prevent hematoma formation. Platysma Muscle: This thin, superficial muscle is divided to expose deeper structures. 3. Deep Layers:\nPre-Tracheal Fascia: Beneath the platysma lies the pre-tracheal fascia, a dense connective tissue layer that encapsulates the thyroid gland, trachea, and esophagus. Thyroid Gland: The thyroid gland may need to be retracted or partially mobilized during the dissection, depending on its size and position relative to the trachea. 4. Surgical Approach:\nMidline Incision: An incision is made along the midline, dividing the strap muscles longitudinally to expose the thyroid gland and trachea. Strap Muscles: These include the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and thyrohyoid muscles, which are carefully separated or retracted to access the trachea. Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve: Attention must be paid to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve that loops around the subclavian artery on the right and the aortic arch on the left, as damage can lead to vocal cord paralysis. 5. Tracheal Dissection:\nOpening the Trachea: Once the trachea is exposed, a transverse incision is made through the anterior tracheal wall between the second and fourth tracheal rings. Cricoid Cartilage: The cricoid cartilage serves as a landmark for the lower border of the incision, ensuring adequate clearance and reducing the risk of stenosis. 6. Tube Placement:\nTracheostomy Tube: A fenestrated or non-fenestrated tracheostomy tube is inserted through the tracheal opening, secured with sutures, and connected to a ventilator or oxygen supply as needed. Confirmation: Proper tube positioning is confirmed by auscultation, capnography, and chest X-ray to ensure correct placement and lung inflation. Complications and Postoperative Care # Despite meticulous surgical technique, tracheostomy carries risks such as bleeding, infection, tube misplacement, and damage to adjacent structures. Close monitoring in the postoperative period is essential to mitigate these risks and ensure optimal patient outcomes.\nConclusion # The surgical anatomy of tracheostomy underscores the importance of precise knowledge and skill in dissecting the layers of the neck. Understanding the relationship between superficial and deep structures, along with the critical landmarks like the cricoid cartilage and thyroid isthmus, facilitates safe and effective tracheostomy placement. Surgeons must navigate these complexities with care, always prioritizing patient safety and well-being.\nIn conclusion, mastering the surgical anatomy of tracheostomy through layered dissection is fundamental for healthcare providers involved in airway management and critical care, ensuring that this life-saving procedure is performed with precision and expertise.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/docs/surgery/longcase/genitourinary/bladder-ca/","title":"üëí Bladder CA","section":"üçë Genitourinary","content":" Haematuria History # True Haematuria or Not # Exact Color: Dark tea color (OJ) Exclude Pseudohaematuria: Itching \u0026amp; steatorrhoea Factitious Haematuria: Munchausen‚Äôs syndrome, narcotic seeking behavior Past History # Bleeding diathesis \u0026amp; other bleeding manifestations Relation of Gross Haematuria to Urinary Stream # Initial (urethra distal to urogenital diaphragm) Total (bladder proper or upper urinary tract) Terminal (trigone/ bladder neck of prostatic urethra) Painless or Painful # Painless: Malignant but can cause pain due to clot colics Painful: Urinary tract infection or calculus, papillary necrosis, passage of clots, obstruction, loin-pain haematuria syndrome, glomerulonephritis Clots # Indicate non-glomerular bleeding Large, thick, irregular clots - bladder Small, linear clots - upper tract Passage of tissues Associated Symptoms # LUTS Fever, chills \u0026amp; rigors with loin pain or suprapubic pain Any loin pain with self-felt loin lumps (Classic triad of RCC 10% - haematuria+loin pain+loin mass) Tissue passage Vaginal or penile discharge, sexual activity Presence of urinary catheter Relation to menstruation (endometriosis) Anemic symptoms GU History # History of BPH, stone disease (Hx of GU cancers) Hx of instrumentation Hx of pelvic irradiation Aetiology for Malignancies # Smoking Occupational exposure to dye stuffs and rubber compounds Hx of travel to middle east countries (Schistosoma haematobium) Family history malignancy (bleeding diathesis + renal disease) Metastatic Features # Fitness for Sx PMHx- # PSHx- # Drug Hx- # Antiplatelets or anticoagulants, cyclophosphamide SHx- # Job(risk factors)/family Smoking/alcohol Disability/concerns Examination # General # Anemia/plethora Facial oedema/ periorbital oedema, rather than ankle edema suggest renal pathology Unilateral or bilateral ankle edema- think of Iliac vein compression in unilateral edema Bone tenderness Muscle weakness Malignant cachexia- anaemia asthenia anorexia Ask for BP Abdomen # Palpable suprapubic mass- distended bladder, anterior wall bladder tumor Ballotable renal mass Hepatomegaly Ascites DRE \u0026amp; genital Ex (non-reducing left varicocele) Summary # This 60 yrs old ASA 2, MET score \u0026gt;4, male patient with episodic visible haematuria over 3 months associated with occasional clots \u0026amp; passage of tissues.

As a practical measure to overcome delays, consider performing an ultrasound scan of bilateral breasts as the initial imaging investigation. Patients with a clinical and radiological suspicion of malignancy should be referred to the nearest radiology unit with facilities to perform a mammogram. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast is recommended in patients with inconclusive findings on ultrasound and mammography. Pathology # Biopsy and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Guidelines # Core Needle Biopsy and Axillary Lymph Nodes # Core needle biopsy of suspicious breast lesions and either fine needle cytology or core needle biopsy of suspicious axillary lymph nodes should be performed preferably under image guidance. Obtain at least 2 cores, and in patients with suspected multifocal disease, biopsy all lesions as far as possible. For patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy to facilitate breast conservation surgery, consider placing surgical clips under ultrasound guidance. Biopsy Approach # Excision biopsy is strongly discouraged unless at least two attempts at core needle biopsy failed to yield a confirmatory diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Testing # Perform IHC for Oestrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), Her2/Neu overexpression (Her2), and the proliferation marker Ki67 in all core biopsy samples with invasive cancer. Report IHC for ER, PR, and Her2 according to the ASCO/CAP guidelines. For patients with equivocal Her2 overexpression on IHC, test for gene amplification using in-situ hybridization (ISH) techniques to detect Her2 gene amplification. ISH Testing and Cost Considerations # ISH testing is currently not available in the state sector. It can only be performed elsewhere if patients can afford its cost. Until ISH testing is available in the state sector, consider establishing a mechanism for this investigation to be performed outside of the state sector at no cost to the patient.

Other Investigations # We recommend performing the following tests: Complete blood count Liver and renal profile Serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels Echocardiography Do not recommend performing the tumor marker CA 15.3, as it has no proven value in early or locally advanced breast cancer. Recommended timelines for diagnostic workup # Investigation Timeframe Time to first Specialist Consultation Next available clinic (within 1 week) Imaging: Ultrasonography 2 weeks from date of request (in patients of high clinical suspicion of malignancy) Imaging: Mammography 2 weeks from date of request (in patients with high suspicion on clinical and ultrasonic evidence) Imaging: Staging 2 weeks from date of request Core needle Biopsy (CNB) 1 week after ultrasonography and mammography Histopathology Reporting (initial) 2 weeks after CNB Immunohistochemistry of CNB 3 weeks after CNB Management # Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) Indications T4, including inflammatory breast cancer N2 or more regardless of tumour biology Depending on the response to NAC mastectomy or breast conservative surgery with standard axillary clearance is recommended. T1 N0 - Sx: upfront surgery regardless of tumor biology eminently resectable with breast conservation surgery. T1-T2 N1 or T3 N0-1 + HER2 positive or triple negative considering NAC as a strategy for facilitating breast conservation surgery is recommended. Sx: wide local excision followed by standard axillary clearance after completing NAC. T2 N0 and HER2 positive or triple negative evaluating the merits of NAC and its impact on axilla treatment on an individual basis is recommended. If these patients are treated with NAC, performing a sentinel node biopsy prior to NAC or a standard axillary clearance after NAC is advised. Post-NAC sentinel node biopsy should be undertaken with caution. ER+ Her2- + T1-T2 N1 and T3 N0-1 Sx: upfront surgery since the response to NAC is poor. Placement of surgical clips under ultrasound guidance is mandatory prior to NAC if it is undertaken with a view to facilitating breast conservation surgery. Receptor Status TNM Staging Management Recommendations HER2 positive or triple negative T1-T2 N1 or T3 N0-1 Consider NAC to facilitate breast conservation surgery. Wide local excision followed by standard axillary clearance after NAC. HER2 positive or triple negative T2 N0 Evaluate merits of NAC individually. Perform sentinel node biopsy prior to NAC or standard axillary clearance after NAC. ER+ Her2- T1-T2 N1 or T3 N0-1 Proceed with upfront surgery; poor response to NAC. Any receptor status T4 or N2 or more nodal disease Indicated for NAC. Breast conservation surgery or mastectomy with standard axillary clearance based on NAC response. T1 N0 Upfront surgery recommended; often eminently resectable with breast conservation surgery. Mastectomy versus Breast Conservation Surgery # Primary Treatment Options for non-metastatic breast cancer: Breast Conservation Surgery (BCS) or Mastectomy. Contraindications to BCS: Multicentric disease. T4 primary tumor (including inflammatory breast cancer). Large tumor relative to breast volume. Contraindications for adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy. Recommendations for BCS: BCS is the treatment of choice for early breast cancer patients without contraindications. Patients suitable for BCS should be informed of the following: BCS has equal or possibly superior survival compared to mastectomy. Better long-term quality of life and functional outcome for patients treated with BCS. BCS Margins: In patients undergoing BCS for invasive cancer: Absence of tumor (invasive cancer and DCIS) at the inked margin is sufficient. If a positive inked margin is found, re-excision is recommended. If margins remain positive after two excision attempts, consider offering mastectomy. Mastectomy Patients: All patients treated with mastectomy should be offered breast reconstruction. Treatment of axilla # Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) Recommendations for patients with cT1-2 N0 tumors: Perform SLNB using either methylene blue dye, radiopharmaceutical tracer, or a combination of both. Intra-operative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes using imprint cytology, cytology smears, or frozen section. Exercise caution when performing SLNB in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to limited experience. Axillary Clearance Criteria for patients in whom SLNB is performed: Three or more macrometastases (\u0026gt;2mm) or any macrometastases with extra-nodal extension: Perform axillary clearance. For 1-2 macrometastases, consider axillary clearance if any of the following criteria are met: Treatment of the primary tumor is mastectomy. Grade III tumor. Tumor size is more than 2cm. ER negative or Her2 positive on IHC. Alternative to SLNB: If SLNB is not feasible, consider axillary nodal sampling in patients with cT1-2 N0 tumors. Axillary Clearance Recommendations: Recommended for all patients with cT3 or higher primary tumors. Also recommended for those with cN1 or higher axillary nodal stage. Standard axillary clearance includes dissection of levels I and II, harvesting a minimum of 10 lymph nodes. Adjuvant therapy # Adjuvant Radiotherapy After Breast Conservation: Offer whole breast radiotherapy to all patients with invasive cancer or DCIS treated with breast conservation surgery.

For patients receiving nodal radiotherapy: 40 Gy in 15 fractions over three weeks. Adjuvant Chemotherapy # Benefit of Adjuvant Chemotherapy # Adjuvant chemotherapy should be offered to all patients in the following categories who are fit enough to receive it: Patients with triple negative or HER2 positive tumors which are of T1b N0 or higher stage Patients with luminal A tumors which are pT3 N0 or pN2 or higher nodal stage Patients with luminal B HER2 negative tumors which are pT3 N0 or pN1 or higher nodal stage We recommend weighing the risk and benefit in patients with pT1-2 N0 Luminal B Her2 negative patients on an individual basis. Adjuvant Chemotherapy Regimen # Offer dose-intensified anthracycline and taxane based regimens for use in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings for patients who are fit enough to receive it. Consider carboplatin based chemotherapy regimens in patients with triple negative tumors receiving neoadjuvant treatment. Consider adjuvant capecitabine in patients with triple negative tumors not achieving a complete pathological response after treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy if the regimens did not contain a platinum agent. Anti-HER2 Therapy # Trastuzumab Offer adjuvant trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy to all patients with HER2+ tumors which are of T1b N0 or higher stage and fit enough to receive it. In patients receiving taxane based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, adjuvant trastuzumab should be delivered concurrently with taxanes. Consider weekly Paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab for patients with T1-T2 (less than 3cm) N0 HER2+ tumors. In patients with HER2+ tumors being offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy (see section 3.2), trastuzumab should be delivered in combination with a taxane. Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy # Premenopausal Patients # Offer ovarian suppression with either surgery or GnRH analogues for premenopausal patients with ER+ tumors if younger than 40 years of age or adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated based on tumor risk stratification. Offer adjuvant tamoxifen for 5-10 years in patients with ER+ tumors not treated with ovarian suppression. Offer adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor as for postmenopausal patients in patients treated with ovarian suppression. Postmenopausal Patients # Offer adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) for post-menopausal patients with ER+ tumors for 5 years. Offer adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen for 5-10 years in patients not tolerating aromatase inhibitors. Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy in DCIS # Consider adjuvant endocrine therapy as a strategy of reducing the risk of breast cancer recurrence in selected patients with ER+ DCIS after explaining the risks of treatment and that there is no reduction in mortality with such treatment. Adjuvant Bisphosphonate Therapy # Offer adjuvant intravenous zoledronic acid 4mg every six months for five years for all post-menopausal breast cancer patients, including patients with chemotherapy-induced menopause and those treated with ovarian suppression. Follow-up Schedule After Adjuvant Treatment # First 2 years: Clinical review every¬†3 months Next 3 years: Clinical review every¬†6 months Subsequent 5 years: Annual clinical review Additionally, an¬†annual mammogram¬†should be performed throughout these 5 years. Regular follow-up ensures timely assessment and helps manage any potential recurrence or new developments.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/posts/slbreastguidelinesummary/","title":"üèµÔ∏è SL Breast Guideline Summary","section":"üçÄ Surgical Notes","content":" Clinical Evaluation # The triple assessment of clinical examination, imaging, and histopathology remains the cornerstone of the diagnostic work-up in patients suspected to have breast cancer. Obtain a full history and perform a complete general examination, including an examination of the breasts, axillae, and supraclavicular fossae.

As a practical measure to overcome delays, consider performing an ultrasound scan of bilateral breasts as the initial imaging investigation. Patients with a clinical and radiological suspicion of malignancy should be referred to the nearest radiology unit with facilities to perform a mammogram. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast is recommended in patients with inconclusive findings on ultrasound and mammography. Pathology # Biopsy and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Guidelines # Core Needle Biopsy and Axillary Lymph Nodes # Core needle biopsy of suspicious breast lesions and either fine needle cytology or core needle biopsy of suspicious axillary lymph nodes should be performed preferably under image guidance. Obtain at least 2 cores, and in patients with suspected multifocal disease, biopsy all lesions as far as possible. For patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy to facilitate breast conservation surgery, consider placing surgical clips under ultrasound guidance. Biopsy Approach # Excision biopsy is strongly discouraged unless at least two attempts at core needle biopsy failed to yield a confirmatory diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Testing # Perform IHC for Oestrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PR), Her2/Neu overexpression (Her2), and the proliferation marker Ki67 in all core biopsy samples with invasive cancer. Report IHC for ER, PR, and Her2 according to the ASCO/CAP guidelines. For patients with equivocal Her2 overexpression on IHC, test for gene amplification using in-situ hybridization (ISH) techniques to detect Her2 gene amplification. ISH Testing and Cost Considerations # ISH testing is currently not available in the state sector. It can only be performed elsewhere if patients can afford its cost. Until ISH testing is available in the state sector, consider establishing a mechanism for this investigation to be performed outside of the state sector at no cost to the patient. Ki67 Risk Stratification # For Ki67, consider: \u0026lt;10% as low risk 10-20% as intermediate risk \u0026gt;20% as high risk Categorization of Patients # Categorize patients based on the IHC profile into: Luminal A Luminal B Her2 Negative Luminal B Her2 Positive Her2 Positive (non-luminal) Triple Negative LUMINAL A LUMINAL B TRIPLE NEGATIVE HER-2 ENRICHED ER+ and/or PR+ ER+ ER+ and/or PR+ ER- ER- HER-2 - and/or PR+ HER-2 - / HER-2 + PR- PR- HER-2 - HER-2 - HER-2 + Ki-67 \u0026lt; 14% (Low proliferation) Ki-67 = 14% (High proliferation) - - Most common (‚âà 70%) 10% Common in premenopausal, young \u0026amp; overweight patients Less common Grade Low grade Intermediate to high grade High grade Mid to high grade Prognosis Good prognosis Prognosis worse than luminal A but better than HER-2 enriched tumor Poor prognosis Prognosis much improved since trastuzumab Treatment Respond to endocrine therapy Respond to cytotoxics + anti-HER-2 + endocrine therapy Respond to cytotoxics therapy Respond to cytotoxics + anti-HER-2 therapy Staging # Routine staging (computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen and bone scintigraphy) is recommended in patients with locally advanced disease (T3, T4, or N2 disease) and in other patients with symptoms suggestive of metastatic disease. Other Investigations # We recommend performing the following tests: Complete blood count Liver and renal profile Serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels Echocardiography Do not recommend performing the tumor marker CA 15.3, as it has no proven value in early or locally advanced breast cancer. Recommended timelines for diagnostic workup # Investigation Timeframe Time to first Specialist Consultation Next available clinic (within 1 week) Imaging: Ultrasonography 2 weeks from date of request (in patients of high clinical suspicion of malignancy) Imaging: Mammography 2 weeks from date of request (in patients with high suspicion on clinical and ultrasonic evidence) Imaging: Staging 2 weeks from date of request Core needle Biopsy (CNB) 1 week after ultrasonography and mammography Histopathology Reporting (initial) 2 weeks after CNB Immunohistochemistry of CNB 3 weeks after CNB Management # Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) Indications T4, including inflammatory breast cancer N2 or more regardless of tumour biology Depending on the response to NAC mastectomy or breast conservative surgery with standard axillary clearance is recommended. T1 N0 - Sx: upfront surgery regardless of tumor biology eminently resectable with breast conservation surgery. T1-T2 N1 or T3 N0-1 + HER2 positive or triple negative considering NAC as a strategy for facilitating breast conservation surgery is recommended. Sx: wide local excision followed by standard axillary clearance after completing NAC. T2 N0 and HER2 positive or triple negative evaluating the merits of NAC and its impact on axilla treatment on an individual basis is recommended. If these patients are treated with NAC, performing a sentinel node biopsy prior to NAC or a standard axillary clearance after NAC is advised. Post-NAC sentinel node biopsy should be undertaken with caution. ER+ Her2- + T1-T2 N1 and T3 N0-1 Sx: upfront surgery since the response to NAC is poor. Placement of surgical clips under ultrasound guidance is mandatory prior to NAC if it is undertaken with a view to facilitating breast conservation surgery. Receptor Status TNM Staging Management Recommendations HER2 positive or triple negative T1-T2 N1 or T3 N0-1 Consider NAC to facilitate breast conservation surgery. Wide local excision followed by standard axillary clearance after NAC. HER2 positive or triple negative T2 N0 Evaluate merits of NAC individually. Perform sentinel node biopsy prior to NAC or standard axillary clearance after NAC. ER+ Her2- T1-T2 N1 or T3 N0-1 Proceed with upfront surgery; poor response to NAC. Any receptor status T4 or N2 or more nodal disease Indicated for NAC. Breast conservation surgery or mastectomy with standard axillary clearance based on NAC response. T1 N0 Upfront surgery recommended; often eminently resectable with breast conservation surgery. Mastectomy versus Breast Conservation Surgery # Primary Treatment Options for non-metastatic breast cancer: Breast Conservation Surgery (BCS) or Mastectomy. Contraindications to BCS: Multicentric disease. T4 primary tumor (including inflammatory breast cancer). Large tumor relative to breast volume. Contraindications for adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy. Recommendations for BCS: BCS is the treatment of choice for early breast cancer patients without contraindications. Patients suitable for BCS should be informed of the following: BCS has equal or possibly superior survival compared to mastectomy. Better long-term quality of life and functional outcome for patients treated with BCS. BCS Margins: In patients undergoing BCS for invasive cancer: Absence of tumor (invasive cancer and DCIS) at the inked margin is sufficient. If a positive inked margin is found, re-excision is recommended. If margins remain positive after two excision attempts, consider offering mastectomy. Mastectomy Patients: All patients treated with mastectomy should be offered breast reconstruction. Treatment of axilla # Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) Recommendations for patients with cT1-2 N0 tumors: Perform SLNB using either methylene blue dye, radiopharmaceutical tracer, or a combination of both. Intra-operative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes using imprint cytology, cytology smears, or frozen section. Exercise caution when performing SLNB in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy due to limited experience. Axillary Clearance Criteria for patients in whom SLNB is performed: Three or more macrometastases (\u0026gt;2mm) or any macrometastases with extra-nodal extension: Perform axillary clearance. For 1-2 macrometastases, consider axillary clearance if any of the following criteria are met: Treatment of the primary tumor is mastectomy. Grade III tumor. Tumor size is more than 2cm. ER negative or Her2 positive on IHC. Alternative to SLNB: If SLNB is not feasible, consider axillary nodal sampling in patients with cT1-2 N0 tumors. Axillary Clearance Recommendations: Recommended for all patients with cT3 or higher primary tumors. Also recommended for those with cN1 or higher axillary nodal stage. Standard axillary clearance includes dissection of levels I and II, harvesting a minimum of 10 lymph nodes. Adjuvant therapy # Adjuvant Radiotherapy After Breast Conservation: Offer whole breast radiotherapy to all patients with invasive cancer or DCIS treated with breast conservation surgery. Consider not offering whole breast radiotherapy in patients above 65 years who meet the following criteria: DCIS, T1 or T2 tumors less than 3cm. Node negative. ER+ PR+ Her2. Grade 1-2. Willing to take endocrine treatment for 5 years. Post-Mastectomy Adjuvant Radiotherapy (PMRT): Recommended for: T3 or T4 invasive cancer. 4 or more involved axillary lymph nodes. 1-3 involved lymph nodes with macrometastases. Positive margins. Considered in patients with 1-3 involved lymph nodes with micrometastases. Not offered for patients with pT1-2 N0 invasive cancer. Dose of Radiotherapy: For patients offered adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy or post-mastectomy radiotherapy (without nodal irradiation): 26 Gy in five fractions over one week. For patients receiving nodal radiotherapy: 40 Gy in 15 fractions over three weeks.

Adjuvant Chemotherapy Regimen # Offer dose-intensified anthracycline and taxane based regimens for use in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings for patients who are fit enough to receive it. Consider carboplatin based chemotherapy regimens in patients with triple negative tumors receiving neoadjuvant treatment. Consider adjuvant capecitabine in patients with triple negative tumors not achieving a complete pathological response after treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy if the regimens did not contain a platinum agent. Anti-HER2 Therapy # Trastuzumab Offer adjuvant trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy to all patients with HER2+ tumors which are of T1b N0 or higher stage and fit enough to receive it. In patients receiving taxane based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, adjuvant trastuzumab should be delivered concurrently with taxanes.

Present alternatives (e.g., Breast-Conserving Surgery). Inform about post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Explain potential post-operative complications. Pre-operative Ward Preparation # Mark the surgical site. Mark the incision in the supine position and verify in the sitting position. Ensure 1 pint of blood is ready. Shave the axilla. In the Theatre # Preparation # WHO safety checklist. Position patient supine arm abducted at 90 degrees on an arm board, with a sandbag under the ipsilateral scapula. Insert a cannula in the opposite forearm. Place mammogram on illuminator and reconfirm the surgical site. Administer GA with endotracheal intubation. Team Positioning # Surgeon stands on the side of the lesion. 1st assistant at the head end. 2nd assistant on the opposite side. Sterilization and Draping # Clean from chin to umbilicus, opposite nipple to posterior axillary fold, and the upper limb (axilla, shoulder, and arm up to the elbow). Drape the arm separately. Expose the breast and axilla from the clavicle to 2 cm below the inframammary fold. Marking the Incision # Transverse elliptical skin incision including: Tumor with a 2 cm margin. Biopsy site. Nipple-Areola Complex. Extend from the lateral border of the sternum to the anterior axillary line. Check for approximation. Tip Remark the incision with methylene blue. Tip for Marking the incision\nMark the medial and lateral ends. Draw the breast firmly downwards and mark a straight line connecting the two points. Similarly, mark the lower flap by drawing the breast up. Upper Flap Dissection # Incise the skin with a No. 23 blade. Place skin hooks and hold up vertically. Apply counter traction on the breast using a gauze towel. Dissection plane is between small pale subcutaneous fat and large bright breast fat by dividing Cooper\u0026rsquo;s ligaments (with a scalpel). The raised flap should be about 0.5 - 1 cm thick. Dissection limit: Extend up to the top of the breast (2nd rib). Achieve hemostasis and place a saline-soaked towel under the flap. Warning Avoid buttonholing. Lower Flap Dissection # Position: Surgeon turn towards the lower side of the body. Dissect the flap similar to the upper flap Dissection limit is up to the lower border of the breast (6th rib). Dissection of breast off pectoralis # Retract superior-medial margin of upper flap using Czerny retractor Retract the breast laterally. Incise the pectoral fascia. Dissect off the breast from the pectoralis muscle with the pectoralis fascia. Ligate the perforator vessels entering the deep surface of the breast. Dissection limit using sharp dissection is up to the lateral border of the pectoralis major and anterior border of the latissimus dorsi. serratus anterior, and latissimus dorsi. Keep the separated breast supported in a folded towel. Place two wet towels underneath each flap. Danger If pactoralis major is invaded\nRemove the breast with a cuff of muscle with a 2 cm margin. Axillary dissection # Exposing the Axilla # Indentify Pectoralis minor by retracting Pectoralis major medially. Rotter\u0026rsquo;s node is excised by blunt dissection. Axillary space is exposed by Retracting latissimus dorsi laterally and retracting the pectoralis major superomedially. Clavipectoral fascia is divided along the lateral border of the pectoralis minor to enter the axilla. Identifying Structures: # Look for the medial pectoral nerve (curves at the edge of the pectoralis minor). Identify the pectoral branch of the thoracoacromial trunk. Axillary Vein Dissection: # Identify the coracoid process. Divide the clavipectoral fascia up to the coracoid process (along the border of pectoralis minor). Perpendicularly deep to coracoid process lies the axillary vein (the largest, bluish vessel in this region). Identify the axillary vein at the apex of the axilla. Axilla Dissection limit: # Superiorly up to the axillary vein. Laterally up to the latissimus dorsi. Medially up to the serratus fascia of the lateral chest wall. Inferiorly up to the angular vein. Lymph Node and Fat Removal: # Strip off lymph nodes and fat from the axillary vein using combined blunt and sharp dissection. Apply gentle traction to the breast and, Remove axillary fat from the apex of the axilla to the posterior axillary fold. Ligate and divide the constant venous tributary from the axillary fat to the axillary vein. Clearing Level 2 Nodes: # Retract pectoralis minor superomedially and Bluntly dissect the fat underneath the pectoralis minor using pledgets. Clear the level 2 nodes with long curved artery forceps up to the medial border of the pectoralis minor. If Level 3 Clearance is Needed: # Divide the pectoralis minor from the coracoid process No need to suture it back. Clear the level 3 nodes up to the costoclavicular ligament. Preserving Nerves # Strip the remaining fat off the lateral chest wall, preserving the serratus fascia long thoracic nerve lies more posteriorly within serratus fascia. Preserve the thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle. Preserve the intercostobrachial nerve if possible. Divide the axillary fat between the branches; if difficult, clean division with scissors and burn the proximal end in the chest wall. Specimen marking: # Remove the breast and the level I and II nodes en bloc. Label with nylon stitches borders of the breast and level I and II lymph nodes separately. Hemostasis and Drainage # Immerse the surgical site with distilled water for 1 minute, then suck out and check for hemostasis. Insert a closed suction drain through a separate stab incision into the axilla. Stab incision should be (2 cm) below the lateral half of the incision. Anchor with nylon. Closure # Subcutaneous tissue with polygalactin interrupted 2/0 (vicryl). Skin subcuticular 3/0 monocryl. Squeeze out blood and air, and activate suction drainage. Postoperative Care # Immediate Care # Adequate Analgesia: Ensure the patient has adequate pain relief. Early Mobilization: Encourage early mobilization of the shoulder with active physiotherapy. Flap Inspection on day 2. Drain Removal on day 5 or when drainage reduces. Change suction to non-suction within 24-48 hours. Discharge Advice to Patient # Avoid Strenuous Activity: Do not engage in repetitive movements for long hours. Limb Care: Avoid accidental injury to the limb. Avoid BP Measurements or cannulation on the affected limb. Cellulitis: If there is any evidence of cellulitis, seek medical attention immediately to start antibiotics. Questions # 1. Why Use a Transverse Scar? # Better Cosmesis: Aligns with Langer lines in the breast, which are horizontal. Functional Outcome: Better functional outcome for the arm. Radiotherapy Advantages: Lung damage is limited to a straight transverse area rather than a large oblique area. For patients with cardiac problems who need Trastuzumab or anthracycline, which are cardiotoxic, a transverse scar on the left side minimizes radiotherapy damage to the heart. Reconstruction: More favorable during reconstruction procedures. 2. What to Do in Case of Accidental Injury to the Axillary Vein? # Immediate Actions:\nPack and apply pressure to the injury site. Inform the anesthetist and vascular team. Prepare blood for transfusion. Surgical Preparation:\nHave the sucker, vascular clamps, vascular tapes, vascular needles, and heparin saline ready. Extend the incision by cutting the pectoralis minor from the coracoid process. Obtain proximal and distal control using a bulldog clamp, Satinsky clamp, vascular tape, or two swabs on holders. Procedure:\nStart a heparin infusion. Repair the defect: Primary Closure: Use 5-0 polypropylene for small defects. Large Defects: Use an interposition graft from the great saphenous vein (GSV).

Pathology # Due to both compression and inflammation - ‚Äòchemical neuroradiculitis‚Äô. nucleus pulposis herniation = Slipped disc Due both compression and inÔ¨Çammation Causes 90% of radiculopathy.

As the thickening increases, the fascia becomes attached to the skin of the palm. Risk factors No obvious predisposing cause Cirrhosis Repeated local trauma Shoe repairers Manual labourers. Epilepsy Age Dupuytren‚Äôs contracture usually begins in middle age, but usually progresses so slowly that most patients do not present until old age. Symptoms Early There is a nodule in the palm. The patient may notice a thickening in the tissues in the palm of the hand, near the base of the ring finger, many years before the contractures develop Late Contraction deformities occur. The patient notices an inability to fully extend the metacarpophalangeal joint of the ring finger, and later the little finger. There is usually no pain associated with this condition, but the nodule in the palm may be slightly tender. Deep creases form where the skin becomes tethered to the fascial thickening, and the skin in these creases may get soggy and excoriated. Multiplicity Dupuytren‚Äôs contracture is commonly bilateral and can also occur in the feet. Risk factor Dupuytren‚Äôs contracture may follow repeated trauma to the palm of the hand, which is probably why it used to be found in shoe repairers and other manual workers, but nowadays it is uncommon to find a convincing cause. may be symptoms of epilepsy or cirrhosis of the liver.There is a higher incidence of the condition in patients suffering from these diseases. If so, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Examination Palpation of the palm of the hand reveals a firm, irregularly shaped nodule with indistinct edges, 1‚Äì2 cm proximal to the base of the ring finger. Taut strands can be felt running from the nodule to the sides of the base of the ring and little fingers, and proximally towards the centre of the flexor retinaculum. The skin is puckered and creased, and tethered to the underlying nodule. The deformity The metacarpophalangeal joint and the proximal interphalangeal joint are flexed because the palmar fascia is attached to both sides of the proximal and middle phalanges. The distal interphalangeal joint tends to extend.The ring finger is most affected and may be pulled down so far that its nail digs into the palm of the hand (Fig. The flexion deformity is not lessened by flexing the wrist joint. There may be some thickening of the subcutaneous tissue on the back of the proximal phalanges of the affected fingers, sometimes called Garrod‚Äôs pads. The condition may be present in the feet (lederhosen disease) or penis (Peyronie‚Äôs disease). Congenital contracture of the little finger # The patient is rarely aware of the fact that they have a deformity, accepting it as the normal shape of their little finger. It is mentioned here because, although it is the opposite deformity to a Dupuytren‚Äôs contracture, the student who is unaware of its existence may misdiagnose it. Someone with a congenital contracture of the little finger has this deformity all the time and cannot straighten the finger (Fig. Volkmann‚Äôs ischaemic contracture # This is a shortening of the long flexor muscles of the forearm, caused by fibrosis of the muscles, secondary to ischaemia. The common causes of the ischaemia are direct arterial damage at the time of a fracture near the elbow (most often a supracondylar fracture (see below), a tight plaster that restricts blood flow and arterial embolism. Indeed, the loss of finger movements frequently begins while the arm is immobilized for the treatment of the fracture. Symptoms When muscles become ischaemic, they are usually painful. If a patient complains of pain under their plaster at a point distant from the site of the fracture, remove the plaster and examine the muscles carefully. Movements of the fingers, especially extension, become painful and then limited. The patient soon discovers that they can extend their fingers if they flex their wrist when the forearm is not in a plaster cast. The skin of the hand will be cold and pale as the blood supply of the hand is also diminished. Ischaemia of the nerves in the anterior compartment (the median and anterior interosseous nerves) often causes ‚Äòpins and needles‚Äô (paraesthesia) in the distribution of the median nerve, and sometimes the severe burning pain of ischaemic neuritis. Development As the acute phase passes, the pain slowly fades away, but the restriction of finger extension increases, and the hand becomes claw- like. Inspection The skin of the hand is usually pale, and the hand looks wasted. All the finger joints are flexed, and the anterior aspect of the forearm is thin and wasted. The deformity is called a ‚Äòclaw hand‚Äô (Fig. Palpation In the acute phase, the forearm is swollen and tense, but once this has passed the forearm feels thin, the hand is cool and the pulses at the wrist may be absent. In the later stages, the fibrosis and shortening make the forearm muscles hard and taut. Movement Extension of the fingers is limited, but improves as the wrist is flexed. Further flexion of the fingers (beyond the deformity) can occur, but the grip is weak. Passive forced extension of the fingers is painful in the acute stage and uncomfortable in the established condition. An important diagnostic feature of an ischaemic contracture is that all the muscles, even the damaged ones, have some function, whereas in a claw hand caused by a nerve lesion, some of the muscles are completely paralysed. The heart, great vessels, subclavian and axillary arteries must be examined carefully in case they are the source of an arterial embolus. Palpate the supraclavicular fossa for a cervical rib (see Chapter 9) or subclavian artery aneurysm (see Chapter 10). Carpal tunnel syndrome # The compression can be caused by skeletal abnormalities, swelling of other tissues within the tunnel, or thickening of the retinaculum. It is often associated with pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, myxoedema, previous trauma and osteoarthritis, which all reduce the change in pressure/volume relationship. Age and sex Carpal tunnel syndrome is common in middle-aged females, especially at the menopause. Local symptoms Pins and needles in the fingers, principally the index and middle fingers, is the common presenting symptom. The thumb is sometimes involved. Theoretically, the little finger should never be affected, as it is innervated by the ulnar nerve, but occasionally patients complain that the whole of their hand tingles. Pain in the forearm may also occur. For some (so far unexplained) reason, patients often complain of a pain that radiates from the wrist, up along the medial side of the forearm. There may be an associated loss of hand function. As the compression increases, the axons in the nerve are killed, and objective signs of nerve damage appear. Because the sensitivity of the skin supplied by the median nerve is reduced, the patient notices that she drops small articles and cannot carry out delicate movements. Note that this is not caused by a loss of muscle power, but by the loss of fine discriminatory sensation. Ultimately, if the nerve damage is severe, there may be a loss of motor function, which presents as weakness and paralysis of the muscles of the thenar eminence and the first two lumbricals (see median nerve palsy in Chapter 3). Patients are often woken in the middle of the night by their symptoms. This feature is difficult to explain, but is so characteristic that it is considered to be pathognomonic of the condition. General symptoms An increase in weight commonly exacerbates the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. A change in weight may be secondary to another disease such as myxoedema, diabetes or steroid therapy, or to physiological water retention, as in pregnancy. The patient may have symptoms of arthritis in the wrist and other joints if the condition is secondary to rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Inspection The hand usually looks quite normal, except in advanced cases, where there may be visible wasting of the muscles forming the thenar eminence (Fig. Palpation Pressure on the flexor retinaculum does not produce the symptoms in the hand, but holding the wrist fully flexed for 1 or 2 minutes may induce symptoms. Light-touch sensitivity and two-point discrimination may be reduced in the skin innervated by the median nerve (palm, thumb, index and middle finger). The loss of muscle bulk in the thenar eminence may be easier to feel when these muscles are contracting. Abduction, adduction and opposition of the thumb may be weak, but the muscles that cause these movements are seldom completely paralysed. First, you must exclude other causes of paraesthesia in the hand, such as cervical spondylosis, cervical rib, peripheral neuritis and rare neurological disease. This requires a detailed examination of the head, neck and arm. Second, you must look for evidence of the cause of the carpal tunnel syndrome, such as pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis or myxoedema. Claw hand # This is a deformity in which all the fingers are permanently flexed (Fig. Although an ulnar nerve paralysis makes the hand claw-like, because it causes flexion of the ring and little fingers, it does not cause a true claw hand, because only part of the hand is involved. The causes of claw hand are neurological and musculoskeletal (see Revision panel‚Ä¶ Neurological causes the causes of claw hand (main en griffe) Combined ulnar and median nerve palsy Volkmann‚Äôs ischaemic contracture Advanced rheumatoid arthritis Brachial plexus lesion (medial cord) Spinal cord lesions: Syringomyelia Poliomyelitis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis the deformity is caused by a loss of motor function, there is often an associated sensory loss: ‚Äì trauma to the medial roots and cords, especially birth injuries of the lower cord, as in Klumpke‚Äôs paralysis; infiltration of the brachial plexus by malignant disease. ‚Äì traumatic division of the median and ulnar nerves; peripheral neuritis. Musculoskeletal causes Volkmann‚Äôs ischaemic contracture‚Ä¶ ‚óè Joint disease‚Ä¶ trigger finger # This is a condition in which a finger gets locked in full flexion and will only extend after excessive voluntary effort, or with help from the other hand. When extension begins, it does so suddenly and with a click‚Ä¶ The condition is caused by a thickening of the flexor tendon or paratenon, or a narrowing of the flexor sheath, preventing movement of the tendon within the flexor sheath. Symptoms The patient complains that the finger clicks and jumps as it moves, or gets stuck in a flexed position. A trigger finger is not usually a painful condition, even when force is required to extend it. Cause The patient can occasionally recall an injury to the palm of the hand, which may have caused the tendon or tendon sheath to thicken, but in most cases there is no indication of the cause. Inspection The patient will show you how the finger gets stuck and how it snaps out into extension. Palpation and movement The thickening of the tendon or tendon sheath can be felt at the level of the head of the metacarpal bone. Mallet finger # This is a fixed flexion deformity of the distal interphalangeal joint of a finger, caused by an interruption of the extensor mechanism, either by a rupture of the extensor tendon, or by an avulsion fracture of its insertion. It is also known as ‚Äòbaseball‚Äô finger because the most common cause of the injury is a blow on the tip of the finger by a ball or hard object that forcibly flexes it against the pull of the extensor tendon, which then ruptures or pulls off the bone. The patient usually remembers the original injury but, if the finger is not painful, may not complain about it until the deformity is established and a nuisance. Symptoms The inability to extend the tip of a finger is not a great disability, but for a person with an occupation that requires fine finger movements, including full extension of the distal interphalangeal joints, the deformity can be a serious handicap. When the patient holds out their hand, with the fingers extended, the distal phalanx of the affected finger remains flexed to 15‚Äì20¬∞ (Fig. Ganglion # A ganglion is an encapsulated myxomatous degeneration of fibrous tissue. Symptoms The patient complains of a sharp pain at the base of one finger whenever they grip something tightly. They may also notice a lump at the site of the pain. Site A small, tender nodule can be felt on the palmar surface of the base of a finger, superficial to the flexor sheath. Tenderness Direct pressure on the lump is usually very painful. Shape The nodule is spherical or hemispherical (Fig. Size Flexor sheath ganglia are usually quite small; some cause symptoms when they are only 2‚Äì3 mm in diameter. Surface and edge The surface of the nodule is smooth, and the edge sharply defined. Composition The nodule feels solid and hard. It is usually too small to permit the assessment of any other features such as fluctuation or translucency. Comment Benign giant cell tumours of the flexor sheath present in an identical manner, and are indistinguishable from flexor sheath ganglia. Heberden‚Äôs nodes are bony swellings close to the distal finger joints. They are non-specific, and do not indicate any particular disease. The patient complains of swelling and deformity of their knuckles. There may be a history of an old injury to the finger, or aching pains in both the lumps and the joints. Heberden\u0026rsquo;s nodes # Heberden‚Äôs nodes are commonly found on the dorsal surface of the fingers just distal to the distal interphalangeal joint. They are not mobile, and can be easily recognized as part of the underlying bone (Fig. The joint movements may be slightly restricted by osteoarthritis, and there may be radial deviation of the distal phalanx. The index finger is most often affected. Small adventitious bursae may develop between the skin and the nodes. Comment Heberden‚Äôs nodes do not indicate any specific underlying bone or joint disease, and have no clinical significance.They should not be confused with rheumatoid nodules, which are areas of necrosis ‚ÄòSwan neck‚Äô deformity of the fingers This deformity is hyperextension of the proximal interphalangeal joint, and flexion of the distal interphalangeal joint. surrounded by fibroblasts and chronic inflammatory cells, and are found in all types of connective tissue. Patients with rheumatoid nodules invariably have other evidence of rheumatoid arthritis. Rhumatoid arthritis # All the deformities of rheumatoid arthritis result from the combination of an uneven pull by the tendons and destruction of the joint surfaces. Boutonni√®re deformity (a) opposite of those of the ‚Äòswan neck‚Äô deformity: flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint, and hyperextension of the distal interphalangeal joint (Fig. Thickening of the joints The joints most affected are the metacarpophalangeal and the proximal interphalangeal joints. Swelling of these joints gives the finger a fusiform, spindle shape. Ulnar deviation of the fingers The fingers are pulled towards the ulnar side of the hand, causing a varus deformity at the metacarpophalangeal joints. Flexion of the wrist The wrist joint develops a fixed flexion deformity and usually some ulnar deviation (Fig. In severe rheumatoid arthritis, any tendon may undergo attrition (damage from friction) and rupture. The most common tendons to rupture are the long extensor tendons of the fingers and thumb. Compound palmar ‚Äòganglion‚Äô # This is a term that is applied to an effusion in the synovial sheath that surrounds the flexor tendons. In the UK, it is now invariably secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, but in many other parts of the world it is almost always caused by a tuberculous synovitis. The most common presenting symptom is swelling on the anterior aspect of the wrist and sometimes in the palm of the hand. Pain is uncommon. The patient may notice crepitus during movements of the fingers. Paraesthesia may occur in the distribution of the median nerve. Distension of the flexor tendon synovial sheath produces a soft, fluctuant swelling that can be felt on the anterior aspect of the wrist and lower forearm, and in the palm of the hand. Because the swelling passes beneath the flexor retinaculum, compression of the lump on one side of the retinaculum makes it distend on the other side. Crepitus may be felt during palpation and when the patient moves their fingers. ‚Äì commonly called ‚Äòmelon seed bodies‚Äô. There are no local signs of inflammation. the joints should be examined to exclude rheumatoid arthritis, and the chest should be examined (and X-rayed) to exclude tuberculosis. The fingernails # The nails are usually pale pink. The most common cause of nail pallor is anaemia. Splinter Haemorrhage # Splinter haemorrhages are small extravasations of blood from the vessels of the nail bed caused by minute arterial emboli. They are long, thin, red‚Äì brown streaks, their long axis running towards the end of the finger.Their colour and shape make them look like splinters of wood beneath the nail (see Fig. The presence of splinter haemorrhages is an important physical sign because they are usually caused by emboli from a bacterial endocarditis or a fulminating septicaemia. They may also occur in rheumatoid arthritis, mitral stenosis and severe hypertension. Clubbing # If you look at your finger from the side, you will see that the plane of the nail and the plane of the skin covering the base of the nail bed form an angle of 130‚Äì170¬∞ (see Chapter 1). In clubbed nails, there is hypertrophy of the tissue beneath the nail bed, which makes the base of the nail bulge upwards, and distorts nail growth so that the nail becomes curved. The terminal phalanx may enlarge to make the end of the finger bulbous (Revision panel 4.11). Spoon shaped nails # (Koilonychia) A normal nail is convex transversely and longitudinally, the degree of curvature varying considerably from person to person. Loss of both these curves produces a hollowed-out spoon-shaped nail (koilonychia) (see Fig. When a patient complains that their nails have changed from a normal to a spoon shape, it is very likely that they have developed anaemia following chronic loss of blood, usually from menorrhagia or haemorrhoids. Subungual haematoma and melanoma # A collection of blood beneath the nail is called a subungual haematoma. It is then important to decide whether the brown spot is haemosiderin or melanin‚Ä¶ A haematoma is usually reddish-brown, with sharp edges. A melanoma is brown with a greyish tinge, and has indistinct edges (Fig. Haematomas move down the nail; melanomas do not move. If it is not possible to make a definite clinical diagnosis, the patient should be managed as if they have a melanoma until you prove otherwise. Glomous tumor # This is a very rare tumour, but is mentioned because it can cause a great deal of pain, and often occurs beneath the nail. It is an angioneuromyoma. The patient complains of severe pain every time the nail is touched. Examination usually reveals a small, purple‚Äì red spot beneath the nail (Fig. The colour is caused by the angiomatous nature of the tumour; the pain comes from its abnormally rich nerve supply. Other nail conditions # Myxoedema: brittle nails Cirrhosis of the liver: white nails.
