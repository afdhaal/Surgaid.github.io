<a class=anchor href=#volkmanns-ischaemic-contracture>#</a></h3><ul><li>This is a shortening of the long flexor muscles of the forearm, caused by fibrosis of the muscles, secondary to ischaemia.</li><li>The common causes of the ischaemia are direct arterial damage at the time of a fracture near the elbow (most often a supracondylar fracture (see below), a tight plaster that restricts blood flow and arterial embolism.</li><li>Indeed, the loss of finger movements frequently begins while the arm is immobilized for the treatment of the fracture.</li><li>Symptoms When muscles become ischaemic, they are usually painful.</li><li>If a patient complains of pain under their plaster at a point distant from the site of the fracture, remove the plaster and examine the muscles carefully.</li><li>Movements of the fingers, especially extension, become painful and then limited.</li><li>The patient soon discovers that they can extend their fingers if they flex their wrist when the forearm is not in a plaster cast.</li><li>The skin of the hand will be cold and pale as the blood supply of the hand is also diminished.</li><li>Ischaemia of the nerves in the anterior compartment (the median and anterior interosseous nerves) often causes ‘pins and needles’ (paraesthesia) in the distribution of the median nerve, and sometimes the severe burning pain of ischaemic neuritis.</li><li>Development As the acute phase passes, the pain slowly fades away, but the restriction of finger extension increases, and the hand becomes claw- like.</li><li>Inspection The skin of the hand is usually pale, and the hand looks wasted.</li><li>All the finger joints are flexed, and the anterior aspect of the forearm is thin and wasted. The deformity is called a ‘claw hand’ (Fig.</li><li>Palpation In the acute phase, the forearm is swollen and tense, but once this has passed the forearm feels thin, the hand is cool and the pulses at the wrist may be absent.</li><li>In the later stages, the fibrosis and shortening make the forearm muscles hard and taut.</li><li>Movement Extension of the fingers is limited, but improves as the wrist is flexed.</li><li>Further flexion of the fingers (beyond the deformity) can occur, but the grip is weak.</li><li>Passive forced extension of the fingers is painful in the acute stage and uncomfortable in the established condition.</li><li>An important diagnostic feature of an ischaemic contracture is that all the muscles, even the damaged ones, have some function, whereas in a claw hand caused by a nerve lesion, some of the muscles are completely paralysed.</li><li>The heart, great vessels, subclavian and axillary arteries must be examined carefully in case they are the source of an arterial embolus.</li><li>Palpate the supraclavicular fossa for a cervical rib (see Chapter 9) or subclavian artery aneurysm (see Chapter 10).</li></ul><h3 id=carpal-tunnel-syndrome>Carpal tunnel syndrome
<a class=anchor href=#carpal-tunnel-syndrome>#</a></h3><ul><li>The compression can be caused by skeletal abnormalities, swelling of other tissues within the tunnel, or thickening of the retinaculum.</li><li>It is often associated with pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, myxoedema, previous trauma and osteoarthritis, which all reduce the change in pressure/volume relationship.</li><li>Age and sex Carpal tunnel syndrome is common in middle-aged females, especially at the menopause.</li><li>Local symptoms Pins and needles in the fingers, principally the index and middle fingers, is the common presenting symptom.</li><li>The thumb is sometimes involved.</li><li>Theoretically, the little finger should never be affected, as it is innervated by the ulnar nerve, but occasionally patients complain that the whole of their hand tingles.</li><li>Pain in the forearm may also occur.</li><li>For some (so far unexplained) reason, patients often complain of a pain that radiates from the wrist, up along the medial side of the forearm.</li><li>There may be an associated loss of hand function.</li><li>As the compression increases, the axons in the nerve are killed, and objective signs of nerve damage appear.</li><li>Because the sensitivity of the skin supplied by the median nerve is reduced, the patient notices that she drops small articles and cannot carry out delicate movements.</li><li>Note that this is not caused by a loss of muscle power, but by the loss of fine discriminatory sensation.</li><li>Ultimately, if the nerve damage is severe, there may be a loss of motor function, which presents as weakness and paralysis of the muscles of the thenar eminence and the first two lumbricals (see median nerve palsy in Chapter 3).</li><li>Patients are often woken in the middle of the night by their symptoms.</li><li>This feature is difficult to explain, but is so characteristic that it is considered to be pathognomonic of the condition.</li><li>General symptoms An increase in weight commonly exacerbates the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.</li><li>A change in weight may be secondary to another disease such as myxoedema, diabetes or steroid therapy, or to physiological water retention, as in pregnancy.</li><li>The patient may have symptoms of arthritis in the wrist and other joints if the condition is secondary to rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.</li><li>Inspection The hand usually looks quite normal, except in advanced cases, where there may be visible wasting of the muscles forming the thenar eminence (Fig.</li><li>Palpation Pressure on the flexor retinaculum does not produce the symptoms in the hand, but holding the wrist fully flexed for 1 or 2 minutes may induce symptoms.</li><li>Light-touch sensitivity and two-point discrimination may be reduced in the skin innervated by the median nerve (palm, thumb, index and middle finger).</li><li>The loss of muscle bulk in the thenar eminence may be easier to feel when these muscles are contracting.</li><li>Abduction, adduction and opposition of the thumb may be weak, but the muscles that cause these movements are seldom completely paralysed.</li><li>First, you must exclude other causes of paraesthesia in the hand, such as cervical spondylosis, cervical rib, peripheral neuritis and rare neurological disease. This requires a detailed examination of the head, neck and arm.</li><li>Second, you must look for evidence of the cause of the carpal tunnel syndrome, such as pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis or myxoedema.</li></ul><h3 id=claw-hand>Claw hand
