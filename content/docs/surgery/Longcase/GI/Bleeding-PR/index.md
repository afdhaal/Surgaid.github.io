- **Amount?**
  - Cup/diapers/clots

### Alteration of Bowel Habits
- **Duration**
- **Normal Pattern**
- **Alteration in Frequency?**
  - Volume
  - Copious volume & very short history – dysentery
  - Small amount with some blood & mucus - likely Ca
  - Intermediate volume with a history of weeks to months – UC likely
- **Alteration in Consistency?**
  - Constipation prominent? – annular carcinoma at the rectosigmoid junction
- **Straining, Feeling of Obstruction, Digital Evacuation**
- **Diarrhea Prominent?**
  - Early morning bloody diarrhea
  - Spurious diarrhea (passing mucus and small amount of stool several times a day) – occurs with growth at the ampulla
  - Frequent passage of loose stools along with blood and mucus – IBD
  - Post-constipation diarrhea?
- **Alteration in Shape?**
  - Pencil-like feces passing in constricting growths
- **Pain**
  - Colicky abdominal – left colonic growth causing some degree of obstruction
