# Lipoma
- This is a *cluster of fat cells* that have become *overactive and so distended* with fat. 
- They are never malignant.

## History
- **Duration** - months to years
- **Symptom** - often have multiple lipomas
- **Multiplicity** - Often Multiple

{{< hint "tip" >}}
- *Multiple lipomatosis (Dercumâ€™s disease)*
  - lipomas of all shapes and sizes. 
  - can be painful - **angiolipomas**.

- *Lipomatosis* 
  - is Multiple contiguous lipomas cause enlargement and distortion of the subcutaneous tissues.

## Examination
- **Site** - most common in upper limbs, chest, neck and shoulders.
- **Colour** - Normal. Veins crossing the lipoma visible as faint blue streaks.
- **Tenderness** - not usually tender, but angiolipomas are.
- **Temperature** is normal.
- **Shape and size** 
	- usually spherical, but subcutaneous lipomas are discoid or hemispherical. 
	- Most lipomas are lobulated.
- **Surface** - Smooth, but firm palpation of squeezing reveals the depressions between the lobules.
- **Edge** is not circular. Distinct irregular curves corresponding to each lobule.
- **â€˜slip signâ€™** - it slips away from the examining finger. It is not a very useful or diagnostic feature.
- **Composition** - jelly-like, soft but solid.
- **Fluctuation** - Pseudo-fluctuation. Lipomas often give the impression of fluctuating, they are just yielding to pressure, spreading out in all directions because they are soft.
- **Transillumination** - Lipomas do not transilluminate. but they may light up if light is shone directly across them.

**Diagnostic feature of lipoma**  
- Evidence of *lobulation* on the surface and at the edge is the *most significant physical sign*.
{{< /hint >}}

- **Relations** 
	- may arise within deep structures, such as muscles. 
	- These are fixed deeply
	- Contracting the muscle may make them prominent.
- **Lymph drainage** - Normal.
- **Local tissues** - Multiple lipomas.

{{< hint "danger" >}}
**Pseudo-cystic appearance**
- The physical signs of pseudo-fluctuation and transillumination make them appear cystic, a false impression that emphasizes the diagnostic importance of finding lobulation.
- They do not have a fluid thrill.
