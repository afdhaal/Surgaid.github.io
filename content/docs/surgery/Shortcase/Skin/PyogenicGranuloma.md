# Pyogenic granuloma
- When the *capillary loops* grow too vigorously, they may form a *protruding mass* of tissue that becomes covered with epithelium and is called a *pyogenic granuloma*.
## History
- **Symptoms**
	- history of a minor injury.
	- sometimes following chronic infection eg: paronychia.
- rapidly growing skin lump.
- bleeds easily.
- discharges serous or purulent fluid.
- double in size in a few days.
## Examination
- **Site** - found where injuries are most likely to occur (hands and face).
- **Shape and size** 
	- They begin as a hemispherical nodule that grows upwards and outwards
- **Surface** 
	- Before the surface is epithelialized, it has a covering of dried blood or plasma, and bleeds easily. 
- **Colour** 
	- *Bright red*: At first, they are the bright red colour of healthy granulation tissue 
	- *Pale pink*: but as they get bigger and less vascular, they fade to a pale pink.
	- *White*: When they become covered with epithelium, they turn pink or white.
- **Tenderness** They are sometimes slightly tender.
- **composition** - feel soft.
- **Relations** - confined to the skin.
- **Natural history** 
	- nodule begins to shrink.
	- but it rarely completely disappears.
