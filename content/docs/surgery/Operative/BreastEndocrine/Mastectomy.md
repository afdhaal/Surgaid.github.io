# MASTECTOMY

## Pre-operative

### Consent
- Discuss reconstruction options.
- Present alternatives (e.g., Breast-Conserving Surgery).
- Inform about post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
- Explain potential post-operative complications.

### Pre-operative Ward Preparation
- Mark the surgical site.
- Mark the incision in the supine position and verify in the sitting position.
- Ensure 1 pint of blood is ready.
- Shave the axilla.

## In the Theatre

### Preparation
- WHO safety checklist.
- Position patient 
	- supine
	- arm abducted at 90 degrees on an arm board, with a
	- sandbag under the ipsilateral scapula.
- Insert a cannula in the opposite forearm.
- Place mammogram on illuminator and reconfirm the surgical site.
- Administer GA with endotracheal intubation.

### Team Positioning
- Surgeon stands on the side of the lesion.
- 1st assistant at the head end.
- 2nd assistant on the opposite side.

### Sterilization and Draping
- Clean from 
	- chin to umbilicus, 
	- opposite nipple to posterior axillary fold, and 
	- the upper limb (axilla, shoulder, and arm up to the elbow).
- Drape 
	- the arm separately.
	- Expose the breast and axilla from the clavicle to 2 cm below the inframammary fold.

### Marking the Incision
- Transverse elliptical skin incision including:
    - Tumor with a 2 cm margin.
    - Biopsy site.
    - Nipple-Areola Complex.
  - Extend from the lateral border of the sternum to the anterior axillary line.
  - Check for approximation.



{{< hint "tip" >}}
- Remark the incision with methylene blue.

**Tip for Marking the incision**
- Mark the medial and lateral ends.
- Draw the breast firmly downwards and mark a straight line connecting the two points.
- Similarly, mark the lower flap by drawing the breast up.
{{< /hint >}}

### Upper Flap Dissection
- Incise the skin with a **No. 23 blade**.
- Place **skin hooks** and hold up vertically.
- Apply counter traction on the breast using a **gauze towel**.
- **Dissection plane** is between 
	- small pale subcutaneous fat and 
	- large bright breast fat 
	- by dividing Cooper's ligaments (with a scalpel).
- The **raised flap** should be about 0.5 - 1 cm thick.
- **Dissection limit**: Extend up to the top of the breast (2nd rib).
- Achieve **hemostasis** and place a **saline-soaked towel** under the flap.



{{< hint "warning" >}}
Avoid buttonholing.
{{< /hint >}}

### Lower Flap Dissection
- **Position**: Surgeon turn towards the lower side of the body.
- Dissect the flap similar to the upper flap 
- **Dissection limit** is up to the lower border of the breast (6th rib).

### Dissection of breast off pectoralis
- Retract 
	- superior-medial margin of upper flap using **Czerny retractor**
	- Retract the breast laterally.
- *Incise* the **pectoral fascia**.
- Dissect off the breast from the **pectoralis muscle** with the **pectoralis fascia**.
- *Ligate* the **perforator vessels** entering the deep surface of the breast.
- **Dissection limit** using *sharp dissection* is up to 
	- the lateral border of the pectoralis major 
	- and anterior border of the latissimus dorsi.
	- serratus anterior, and latissimus dorsi.
- Keep the separated breast supported in a **folded towel**.
- Place **two wet towels** underneath each flap.



{{< hint "danger" >}}
**If pactoralis major is invaded**
- Remove the breast with a cuff of muscle with a 2 cm margin.
{{< /hint >}}

### Axillary dissection

#### Exposing the Axilla
- **Indentify Pectoralis minor** by retracting Pectoralis major medially.
- **Rotter's node** is excised by *blunt dissection*.
- **Axillary space** is exposed by
	- Retracting latissimus dorsi laterally and 
	- retracting the pectoralis major superomedially.
- **Clavipectoral fascia** is divided along the lateral border of the pectoralis minor to enter the axilla.
##### Identifying Structures:
- Look for the **medial pectoral nerve** (curves at the edge of the pectoralis minor).
- Identify the *pectoral branch* of the **thoracoacromial trunk**.

#### Axillary Vein Dissection:
- Identify the coracoid process.
- Divide the **clavipectoral fascia** up to the **coracoid process** (along the border of pectoralis minor).
- Perpendicularly deep to coracoid process lies the axillary vein (the largest, bluish vessel in this region).
- Identify the **axillary vein** at the *apex of the axilla*.


#### Axilla Dissection limit:
- *Superiorly* up to the **axillary vein**.
- *Laterally* up to the **latissimus dorsi**.
- *Medially* up to the **serratus fascia** of the lateral chest wall.
- *Inferiorly* up to the **angular vein**.

### Lymph Node and Fat Removal:
- Strip off *lymph nodes and fat* from the **axillary vein** using combined *blunt and sharp dissection*.
- Apply gentle traction to the breast and,
- Remove **axillary fat** from the apex of the axilla to the posterior axillary fold.
- Ligate and divide the *constant* **venous tributary** from the axillary fat to the axillary vein.

#### Clearing Level 2 Nodes:
- Retract pectoralis minor superomedially and
- Bluntly dissect the fat underneath the pectoralis minor using pledgets.
- Clear the **level 2 nodes** with long *curved artery forceps* up to the medial border of the pectoralis minor.

#### If Level 3 Clearance is Needed:
- Divide the pectoralis minor from the coracoid process 
	- No need to suture it back.
- Clear the level 3 nodes up to the **costoclavicular ligament**.

#### Preserving Nerves
- Strip the remaining fat off the lateral chest wall, preserving the **serratus fascia**
	- **long thoracic nerve** lies more posteriorly within serratus fascia.
- Preserve the thoracodorsal neurovascular bundle.
- Preserve the intercostobrachial nerve if possible.
	- Divide the axillary fat between the branches; 
	- if difficult, clean division with scissors and burn the proximal end in the chest wall.

### Specimen marking:
- Remove the breast and the level I and II nodes en bloc.
- Label with nylon stitches borders of the breast and level I and II lymph nodes separately.

### Hemostasis and Drainage
- Immerse the surgical site with distilled water for 1 minute, then suck out and check for hemostasis.
- Insert a closed suction drain through a separate stab incision into the axilla.
	- Stab incision should be (2 cm) below the lateral half of the incision.
	- Anchor with nylon.

### Closure
- Subcutaneous tissue with polygalactin interrupted **2/0 (vicryl)**.
- Skin subcuticular **3/0 monocryl.**
- Squeeze out blood and air, and activate suction drainage.

## Postoperative Care

### Immediate Care
- **Adequate Analgesia**: Ensure the patient has adequate pain relief.
- **Early Mobilization**: Encourage early mobilization of the shoulder with active physiotherapy.
- **Flap Inspection** on day 2.
- **Drain Removal** on day 5 or when drainage reduces. Change suction to non-suction within 24-48 hours.

### Discharge Advice to Patient
- **Avoid Strenuous Activity**: Do not engage in repetitive movements for long hours.
- **Limb Care**: Avoid accidental injury to the limb.
- **Avoid BP Measurements** or **cannulation** on the affected limb.
- **Cellulitis**: If there is any evidence of cellulitis, seek medical attention immediately to start antibiotics.

## Questions

### 1. Why Use a Transverse Scar?
- **Better Cosmesis**: Aligns with Langer lines in the breast, which are horizontal.
- **Functional Outcome**: Better functional outcome for the arm.
- **Radiotherapy Advantages**:
	- Lung damage is limited to a straight transverse area rather than a large oblique area.
	- For patients with cardiac problems who need Trastuzumab or anthracycline, which are cardiotoxic, a transverse scar on the left side minimizes radiotherapy damage to the heart.
- **Reconstruction**: More favorable during reconstruction procedures.

### 2. What to Do in Case of Accidental Injury to the Axillary Vein?
**Immediate Actions**:
- Pack and apply pressure to the injury site.
- Inform the anesthetist and vascular team.
- Prepare blood for transfusion.

 **Surgical Preparation**:
- Have the 
	- sucker, 
	- vascular clamps,
	- vascular tapes, 
	- vascular needles, and 
	- heparin saline ready.
- Extend the incision by cutting the pectoralis minor from the coracoid process.
- Obtain proximal and distal control using a 
	- bulldog clamp, 
	- Satinsky clamp, 
	- vascular tape, or 
	- two swabs on holders.

**Procedure**:
- Start a heparin infusion.
- Repair the defect:
	- **Primary Closure**: Use 5-0 polypropylene for small defects.
	- **Large Defects**: Use an interposition graft from the great saphenous vein (GSV).
