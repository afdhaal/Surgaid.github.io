## Fascinating Signs in Surgery

> “If it is a question of doubt in diagnosis, you may often observe that one man solves the doubt when the others could not, and the way in which one man happened to solve it is this: he applied to the diagnosis of the case some method of examination which others had not applied.”  
> —Charles Barrett Lockwood, 1856–1914

**Sign**: An indication of the existence of an objective evidence of a disease, i.e., such evidence as is perceptible to the examining physician, as opposed to the subjective sensation (symptoms) of the patient.

**Pathognomonic Sign**: (patho = disease, gnoma = signature, pathognomonic = signature of the disease) Specially distinctive or characteristic sign of a disease or pathological condition on which a diagnosis can be made.

**Accessory Sign**: (Assident sign) Any non-pathognomonic sign of disease, which adds to the surety of the diagnosis when present.

**Antecedent Sign**: Any precursory indication of an attack of disease. These signs are to be identified at the earliest.
