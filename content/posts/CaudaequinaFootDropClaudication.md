# Cauda equina syndrome, Acute foot drop & neurogenic claudication

## Cauda equina syndrome 
-  **Triad of symptoms** - Cauda equina syndrome (CESR) is deÔ¨Åned as a triad of symptoms including:
1. bilateral lower limb radicular pain
2. perianal sensory loss
3. insensate urinary retention and subsequent incontinence. 
- Often the Ô¨Årst symptom is the radiculopathy. Urogenital symptoms last.

- **Terms**
	- Cauda equina syndrome (CESR)
	- Cauda equina in *evolution* (CESE)  = A patient *progressing through* these symptoms. 
	- *Impending* cauda equina syndrome (CESI ) = A clinical picture with the *absence of the urinary dysfunction*. 
- **Investigation**: CESI, CESE and CESR represent a neurosurgical emergency and when seen mandate an urgent MRI scan 
- **Management**: 
	- surgical decompression within 24-48 hours. 
	- Delays leads to devastating urogenital dysfunction

## Red Ô¨Çags of cauda equina syndrome
- Bilateral leg neurological deÔ¨Åcit
	- major motor weakness 
		- knee extension, 
		- ankle eversion,
		- or foot dorsiÔ¨Çexion 
- Recent-onset urinary retention +/- incontinence 
- Recent-onset faecal incontinence
- Perianal or perineal sensory loss
- lax anal sphincter

## Acute foot drop 
- An acute painful foot drop suggests compression and may need surgical treatment. 
- Painless foot drop is likely a ‚Äòmedical‚Äô aetiology such as diabetes.

- Ankle dorsiÔ¨Çexion 
	- Muscles
		- tibialis anterior, 
		- extensor hallucis longus and 
		- extensor digitorum longus. 
	- Nerve supply mostly L5, with a few from L4.
- L5 outÔ¨Çow is through **common peroneal nerve**.


{{< hint "question" >}}
 How to differentiate between a foot drop of L5 root aetiology and a foot drop from a common peroneal nerve aetiology?

| **Feature**                         | **L5 Root Weakness**                                                             | **Common Peroneal Nerve Aetiology**                 |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Back Pain**                       | Present                                                                          | Absent                                              |
| **Gluteal Weakness**                | Present                                                                          | Absent                                              |
| **Radicular Pain and Paraesthesia** | Present in a dermatomal distribution                                             | Pain and paraesthesia limited to the first webspace |
| **Foot Eversion**                   | Relative preservation (normal foot eversion due to peroneus muscle group, L4-S1) | Impaired                                            |

- Management 
	- early decompression
	- foot drop splints
- Good prognosis, with two-thirds improving by 6 months.


## Lumbar canal stenosis 
- *Neurogenic claudication*
- older patients
- **Clinical features**
	- Spine extension - Classical feature: walking and standing results in U/L or B/L leg pain/numbness/pins and needles
	- Spine Ô¨Çexion: improves symptoms ‚Äò**shopping trolley sign**‚Äô
	- often vague symptoms - legs feel dead
	- symptoms usually *slowly alleviated with rest*
	- signiÔ¨Åcant limitation to walking distance
- **Differential diagnosis**: vascular claudication. 
- **Pathology**
	- often insidiously progresses
	- The compression is mainly from hypertrophy and liagmentum Ô¨Çavum degeneration facet joint to narrow the neural canal and lateral recess.
	- symptomatic when walking due to relative ischaemia of the roots.
- **Management**
	- antineuropathics are unhelpful. 
	- Due to the non-inÔ¨Çammatory nature, steroid injections also unhelpful. 
	- Posterior decompression can improve the claudicant symptoms greatly
